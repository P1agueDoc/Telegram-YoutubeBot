# Telegram-YoutubeBot
A bot to download any video you want (telegram has a 50mb cap on files)

# Telegram bot setup

1 - Transfer files into a folder.

2 - create env. python3 -m venv <virtual_env_name>

3 - activate env. 
windows - <virtual_env_name>\Scripts\activate
Linux -   source <virtual_env_name>/bin/activate

4 - pip install -r requirements.txt

5 - Open .py and, as always, place bot token in the following field:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = ''

6 - Create or Move cookies.txt into your bot folder

(Example: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = '9495rkvcl49gj48:404ivk4i4i4344x42dcv')

6 - python3 YouTube-Bot.py

That's all.

If needed, I can translate the bot's messages to English. Currently, they are in Russian, but it's not really a problem.

# How to use

Type: /video (url of your video)


Hope you like it! i'm still studying python.

The bot supports cookies!!! Just place Cookies.txt in the same folder as the main code, and you're good to go. This is mostly useful if you want to host the bot on a VPS and use it without issues.

# How to make cookies.txt

in firefox - download extension coockies.txt. Go to youtube (you should be logged) and use extension (press on it) to download cookies from youtube.
in chrome - use any other extension that does the job.
