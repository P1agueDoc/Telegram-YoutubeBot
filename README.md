# Telegram-YoutubeBot
A bot to download whatever video you want (telegram set 50mb cap on files)

# Telegram bot setup

1 - Transfer files to one folder.

2 - create env. python3 -m venv <virtual_env_name>

3 - activate env. 
windows - <virtual_env_name>\Scripts\activate
Linux -   source <virtual_env_name>/bin/activate

4 - pip install -r requirements.txt

5 - Open code and as always, place bot toket in field:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = ''

(it should look like that: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = '9495rkvcl49gj48:404ivk4i4i4344x42dcv')

6 - python3 YouTube-Bot.py

That's all.

Also, if needed i can translate bot messages to ENG, currently it's RU but not realy problematic.

# How to use

write in chat where bot located: /video (url of your video)


Hope you like it! i'm still styding python and had to use some small parts of code from other people.

Bot also can use cookies!!! Place Coockies.txt in folder with main code and you're good to go. It's mostly made so you could place bot on vps and use it without problems.

# How to make cookies.txt

in firefox - download extension coockies.txt. Go to youtube (you should be logged) and use extension (press on it) to download cookies from youtube.
in chrome - use any other extension that does the job.
