# Telegram-YoutubeBot
A bot to download whatever video you want (telegram set 50mb cap on files but bot will reduce quality if cap is reached)

# Telegram bot setup

As always. Place bot toket in field:
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = ''

(you need to open code and place token there, it should look like that: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = '9495rkvcl49gj48:404ivk4i4i4344x42dcv')


Also, if needed i can translate bot messages to ENG, currently it's RU but not realy problematic.

How to use:
write in chat where bot located: /video (url of your video)


Hope you like it! i'm still styding python and had to use some small parts of code from other people.
